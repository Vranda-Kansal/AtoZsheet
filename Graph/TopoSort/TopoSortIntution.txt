Intuition

- Basically toposort applicable when there is something related to order.
- Means someone comes before/after that node.
- so the Intuition lies so pick the nodes which have indegree as 0
- when pick those whose indegree is 0 because they would always be on first in the order list they are independent of order
- so the nodes which are reachable from these nodes there indegree would get reduce by 1 means they detach from that node
- so indegree reduce by 1 if any one now become zero it would push back in the queue

Important points:
- whenever there is DAG or DG think about the toposort
- in queue only elements which are not attach with cycle nodes are included
- toposort would Never be call for cyclic nodes bcz there indegree would never be zero.
- if any node reachable by cyclic graph then it would also be not included in toposort because its indegree would never be zero because its parent indegree
cannot be zero so it is impossible to reachout to the children node.
- but if the one whose indegree is zero can reach toh cyclic node as it is not dependent on the cyclic node.
